# RCon Logger
Simple SourceMod plugin for logging RCon commands.

Currently writes all rcon commands to logs/rcon.log

To-Do:
* Log commands via rcon protocol (SMRcon support?)
* Cvars for logging, enable/disable aspects
* Cvar for logging file (by date/single logfile)

Any/all contributions welcome!
